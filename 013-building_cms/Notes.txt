1. Always do a blueprint of software before developing. This prevents cluttering of our brain.

2. After blueprinting, we should model our database, before developing.

3. Set up the project structure.
We have basically two folders in our project folder: public and includes.
public - accessible to users on the web
includes - won't be accessible to the public. This folder may contain includes for database connection for example.
They are accessible in our code, but not accessible on the web.
Note: A further configuration should be done so that our domain name, for example kiyodesigns.com points to the public directory.

4. For our cms, we would need an admin area where we can perform CRUD operations. 
This area will be restricted by authentication.
We also have a public area where we can view the content only. 
Not all contents will be accessible in the public area.

5. For a start, we can code the admin area without authentication, perform some CRUD operations and then view our content in the public area. Always create a common styling template before coding. 
It will be basic CSS just to make our code look like a BASIC website.

6. Do mockup of pages without any PHP.
First of all extract common HTML in header.inc.php and footer.inc.php. 

7. Use require_once any functions files, such as utility functions.

8. Add database interactivity to the pages.
