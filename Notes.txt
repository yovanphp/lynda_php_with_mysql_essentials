PHP configuration
==================
3 things to look at:error reporting, output buffering and timezone.

phpinfo() method describes the way PHP is configured on our machine: localhost:9999/?phpinfo=1 gives us the same info.

- Loaded Configuration File: C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\bin\php.ini - tells us where the configuration file for PHP lives (shortcut accessible in wamp launcher)
Errors
---------
We do a search for display_errors. We can see that it is set to On. We also have commented out values for the display_errors directive:
; Development Value = On
; Production Value = Off
We should set the the production value to off always in production.

error_reporting = E_ALL
=> Show all errors, warnings and notices including coding standards. E_ALL is a number (32767 - bits)

html_errors = On
=> PHP now has the ability to insert HTML links to documentation related to errors. For performance we should disable it in production servers.

Output buffering
-----------------
output_buffering = 4096
Possible values are integer, On and Off.
;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
;   Off = Disabled
;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
We will turn it Off - we will see later why.

Timezone
----------
date.timezone = UTC
Defines the default timezone used by the date functions.
In wamp I saw : date.timezone = Europe/Paris

We can set our server to the timezone at which we are currently at: http:www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

Note: We should restart all wamp services so that our configurations can take effect.

MySQL configuration
====================
Set a new root password (default is '').
Always set a root password as we may import production data someday for debugging.

CMD -> cd C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.17\bin -> mysqladmin -u root password
New password: my_password

If we run the command we get an access denied error as we are telling mysqladmin that we will be providing a password.

mysqladmin -u root -p password
It asks us to enter the current password and the new password.

Note: We have broken phpmyadmin as it is not set to use a password. We should open wamp/apps/phpmyadmin4.1.14/config.inc.php and set the line containing the string password as follows:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'my_password';

How pages are served
======================
1. a. User types in the URL. Browser sends request to web server. 
b. The Apache HTTP daemon is the software that intercepts the request, finds the file in the FS to respond to the request (ex. index.php). 
c. Apache sees that it is a PHP file and hence processes the PHP. 
d. While doing so Apache goes back and forth to the database to get data. 
e. Then Apache renders the HTML, which is sent to the browser.
