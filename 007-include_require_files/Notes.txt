include() and require() are used so that we can keep our code well organised - so that we don't repeat code in pages.

We should include
- functions files
- layout sections like navigation, sidebars, headers and footers
- reusable HTML/PHP code like images carousel
- CSS and JS if they were not included in headers.

There are 4 variations of includes functions:
- include(), require(), and require_once()

require() raises a fatal page error if the page cannot be found. 
include() will continue displaying the page.
include_once() keeps an array of files that are already included. 
If the file has already been included, it will not add it to that array.
require_once() does the same.
