There are only 3 ways that a server can get user data from the web:
- URLS/links -> GET (HTTP method)
- Forms -> POST
- Cookies -> COOKIE

We can send data from a link using the query string (made from query parameters). When clicking on a link, the GET HTTP method is called.

When a page request is made, PHP automatically creates an associative array out of the query parameters.
This associative array is called a Super global variable.

- Super globals are available in all scopes
- Assigned by PHP before processing page code

$_GET is the superglobal associated with URLS and links.
It is not a constant but a variable. $_GET superglobal is an associative array.

Typing a URL or clicking a link makes get requests to the server.

NOTE: We should always encode our query parameters so that they are interpreted correcly.
For example: ?company=Johnson&Peterson
