1. Turn on error reporting in development
- In php.ini file
	display_errors = On
	error_reporting = E_ALL

- In PHP code
ini_set('display_errors', 'On');
error_reporting(E_ALL);

//Return the current level -> returns a number see errorfunc.constants.php on php.net for the complete list.
error_reporting();

There are 4 types of main errors: Fatal, Syntax, Warnings and Notices.

See the logs: C:/wamp/logs/php_error.log

This log file is accessible in the WAMP menu.

Code that can help us debug
----------------------------
echo $var;
print_r($array);
gettype($var);
var_dump($variable); // Both type and value
get_defined_vars(); // array of defined variables
debug_backtrace(); // show stacktrace or backtrace. It gives us a report of functions calls made in certain point in time.


Errors
---------
We do a search for display_errors. We can see that it is set to On. We also have commented out values for the display_errors directive:
; Development Value = On
; Production Value = Off
We should set the the production value to off always in production.

error_reporting = E_ALL
=> Show all errors, warnings and notices including coding standards. E_ALL is a number (32767 - bits)

html_errors = On
=> PHP now has the ability to insert HTML links to documentation related to errors. For performance we should disable it in production servers.

Output buffering
-----------------
output_buffering = 4096
Possible values are integer, On and Off.
;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
;   Off = Disabled
;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
We will turn it Off - we will see later why.

Timezone
----------
date.timezone = UTC
Defines the default timezone used by the date functions.
In wamp I saw : date.timezone = Europe/Paris

We can set our server to the timezone at which we are currently at: http:www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

Note: We should restart all wamp services so that our configurations can take effect.
